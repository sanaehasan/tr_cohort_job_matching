									<h2>Experience History</h2>
									<p>My love for tech had started at an early age, that was the reason I chose to graduate in computer science and finished my Masters in the same domain. After I graduated I started working in a company in that was specialised in web development, especially with PHP using MVC frameworks like Zend. After that, I started my journey as a wife and a mum but i did not stop learning and graduated in business studies as well. however, In my mind, I knew that I will always return to tech because it's my passion, so I found a job that offered a lot of flexibility which was helpful for a mum like me, I worked with WordPress and used my skills in Php creating plugings that suit client's needs. i learned a language called deluge as well, it helps in modifying clients' CRM functionalities to suit there needs. </p>

									<h2>Why return to tech?</h2>
									<p>tech and especially programming is my passion. when I am coding, I get so focused that I cannot hear my surroundings. I can pass hours on my computer resolving coding problems and get a high sense of satisfaction and achievement when I resolve it. i want to find this satisfaction again and do something I love for a living. Tech offers more flexibility and career progress opportunities, in addition to a good salary rate compared with other domains. for me, it's a win-win situation, I do what I love and earn money for it. I do really miss tech environment it's full of highly intelligent people and have an amazing culture as well, it allows people to meet with people from all the levels in the company. this is some of the reasons I want to return back to tech. </p>
